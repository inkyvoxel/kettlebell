## The Routine

This routine was created based on the three kettlebell exercises I enjoy doing the most:

- Swings
- Clean and Press
- Squats

### Progression Timeline

Spend 6–8 weeks on the beginner routine, then 6–12 weeks on this intermediate routine, depending on how comfortably you adapt to single-arm pressing and unilateral swing practice.

### Beginner Workout

- Two-Handed Kettlebell Swing: 3 sets of 10–15 reps, rest for 60 seconds between sets.
- Two-Handed Kettlebell Press: 3 sets of 8–12 reps, rest for 60 seconds between sets.
- Goblet Squats: 3 sets of 8–12 reps, rest for 60 seconds between sets.

### Intermediate Workout

- Two-Handed Kettlebell Swing: 3 sets of 12–15 reps, rest for 60 seconds between sets.
- Single-Arm Kettlebell Press: 3 sets of 8–12 reps per side, rest for 60 seconds between sets.
- Goblet Squats: 3 sets of 8–12 reps (slightly heavier weight or deeper squat), rest for 60 seconds between sets.

Intermediate Notes:

- Single-Arm Kettlebell Press: Start with a lighter weight than your two-handed press (e.g., 8–12kg if you’re using 16kg two-handed). Focus on keeping your core braced and hips stable to avoid leaning. Alternate sides each set or do all reps on one side before switching.
- Swings: Stick with two-handed swings, but you can introduce single-hand swings for one set (e.g., 6 reps per side) to prepare for the advanced routine. Use the same weight (e.g., 16–20kg).
- Goblet Squats: Increase weight slightly (e.g., 16–20kg) or focus on deeper squats with control to progress.

Why Single-Arm Kettlebell Press for Intermediate?

- The Single-Arm Kettlebell Press increases unilateral strength and stability demands compared to the two-handed press, making it a perfect intermediate step. It aligns with your goal of eventually doing single-arm presses.
- It engages the core more to prevent rotation or leaning, preparing you for the advanced clean and press.
- You can start with a lighter weight and progress, making it accessible yet challenging.

### Advanced Workout

- Single-Arm Kettlebell Swing: 3 sets of 12–15 reps per side, rest for 60 seconds between sets.
- Single-Arm Clean and Press: 3 sets of 8–10 reps per side, rest for 60 seconds between sets.
- Goblet Squats: 3 sets of 10–12 reps (heavier weight, e.g., 20–24kg), rest for 60 seconds between sets.

Advanced Notes:

- Single-Arm Kettlebell Swing: Fully transition to single-handed swings (e.g., 20–24kg) for greater core and grip demands.
- Single-Arm Kettlebell Clean and Press: Builds on the Single-Arm Kettlebell Press by adding the clean, which requires explosive pulling and coordination. Practise cleans separately (e.g., 3 sets of 5–8 reps per side with 8–12kg) during the intermediate phase to prepare.
- Goblet Squats: Use a heavier weight and maintain strict form to maximize strength.

### Tips for Transitioning

- Weight Selection: For Single-Arm Kettlebell Press, use a weight you can control for 8 clean reps per side (e.g., 8–12kg). If your two-handed press is 16kg, try 8–10kg per hand to start.
- Form Focus: Keep your feet shoulder-width apart, brace your core, and avoid leaning backward or to the side during single-arm presses.
- Practise for Advanced: During the intermediate phase, add 1–2 sets of single-arm kettlebell cleans (light weight, 5–8 reps per side) weekly to prepare for the clean and press.
- Frequency: Do this routine 2–3 times per week, as discussed previously, ensuring adequate rest (especially if combining with running).
